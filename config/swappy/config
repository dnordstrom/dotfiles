# SWAPPY CONFIGURATION
#
# Swappy is a simple and convenient image annotation tool that is perfect for screenshots. We're
# usually using it with `grim` and `slurp`: select an area of the screen with `slurp`, pass those
# coordinates to `grim` to grab a screenshot of the area, and finally either pipe the output to `swappy`:
# 
# ```
# `grim --output "DP-1" - | swappy --file - --output-file | icat
# ```
#
# The dash, "-", is commonly used to mean "standard output" or "standard input." Above, Grim outputs
# to standard out, Swappy reads that as standard input and shows its editor, then output the result
# to standard out which we pipe to `icat --stdin=yes` to show the final image inside Kitty terminal.
