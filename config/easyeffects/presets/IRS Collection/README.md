# PulseAudio-IRSs
Collection of PulseEffects IRSs. Works with Viper4Android too.

# IRS
IRS s are impulse response profiles which can be configured on Convolver section of [WWMM's PulseEffects](https://github.com/wwmm/pulseeffects).

These can also be used with [Viper4Android](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-viper4android-fx-2-6-0-0-t3774651) convolvers.

# Installation
**For Pulse-Effects:**

Download this repo. Extract the contents of the IRS folder to `PulseEffects/irs` directory you can find in the local `config` directory. Obviously the location of that directory depends on how you installed PulseEffects.

If you installed it through Flatpak, you can find it in `~/.var/app/com.github.wwmm.pulseeffects/config/PulseEffects/irs`, or if you used the PPA for Ubuntu (or the AUR package for Arch) it should be `~/.config/PulseEffects/irs`

**For Viper4Android:**

Download this repo. Extract the contents of IRS folder to the Android 9 or below: `/storage/emulated/0/ViPER4Android/Kernel/`.

Android 10: `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.pittvandewitt.viperfx/files/Kernel/`

# Note
None of these IRS belongs to me. They are publically available over the internet. It's just a collection of them.
