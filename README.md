# My Nix Configurations

This is a flake-based configuration is used on my Dell XPS work laptop as well as my Ryzen 7 home desktop. It uses the unstable channel (which is actually very stable) for packages, and it's a constant work in progress. See the links below for further information on Nix and NixOS.

## Notes to self

* To update Visual Studio Code extension versions that are not in nixpkgs, run this script: https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/misc/vscode-extensions/update_installed_exts.sh
